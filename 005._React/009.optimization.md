## React Rending Cycle
- `Rendering Phase `
    - The Render phase takes your JSX and turns it into a javascript representation of what the HTML structure should look like. This is called the VirtualDOM.
- `Commit Phase`
    - While the commit phase is actually taking that representation and applying it to the real DOM. The whole process is called `reconciliation`.

## Render Phase 
- `An initial render`
     - Initial rendering is when your app first starts up
- `re-render`
    - A re-render is when your state or props have updated.

## Commit Phase 
- Once React has done the comparison between its new and old components using that diff algorithm and has a list of changes. It will go ahead and surgically apply those changes to the actual DOM. Meaning that it will only change the particular elements of the DOM that have changes, not every single element. This is called the commit phase.

## Component Elements Of The Same Type --> Why we need keys in lists
- The main purpose of keys is to help React differentiate and distinguish elements from each other, increasing its performance when diffing between the virtual and real DOM


## useMemo and useCallback
 - useMemo는 값을 반환한다.
 - useCallback은 새로운 함수를 반환합니다.
```js
import "./App.css";
import { useEffect, useState, useMemo, useCallback } from "react";

function AppJSX() {
  const [x, setX] = useState(0);
  const [y, setY] = useState(0);

  const expensiveCalculation = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Running expensive calculation");
    let res = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
      res += i;
    }
    return res;
  }, []); 

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component rendered");
  },); 

  const memoVal = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("memoVal updated");
    return x;
  }, [x]);


  const memoizedExpensiveFunction = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("useCallback called");
  }, [expensiveCalculation]); 

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{x}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setX(x + 1)}>Increment X</button>
      <div>{y}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setY(y + 1)}>Increment Y</button>
      <div>Memoized Value: {memoVal}</div>
      <div>Expensive Calculation Result: {expensiveCalculation}</div>
      <button onClick={memoizedExpensiveFunction}>Run Expensive Function</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default AppJSX;
```
